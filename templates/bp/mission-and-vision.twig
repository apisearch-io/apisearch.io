    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>The e-commerce industry is growing rapidly, with more businesses setting up online stores to cater to a larger customer base. However, one of the major challenges faced by these businesses is providing an efficient search experience on their websites. Traditional search engines often lack advanced search filters, predictive search suggestions, and AI integration, making it difficult for customers to find what they need quickly and easily.</p>
    <p>This problem leads to a poor customer experience, increased bounce rates, and ultimately lost sales for e-commerce businesses. Many existing search engine solutions are complex and lack customization options, making them unsuitable for businesses with unique needs or multiple websites.</p>
    <p>The reliance on ONLY keyword search exacerbates this challenge further. A considerable portion of potential customers may not have a clear idea of what they are looking for, or they might struggle to articulate their needs using specific keywords. This limitation becomes especially pronounced when dealing with products or services that customers may not be familiar with, leading to a considerable number of users not finding what they are looking for. The intricacies of certain products or services might not be effectively conveyed through a simplistic keyword search, leaving customers frustrated and dissatisfied. Moreover, there's a subset of users who might lack the expertise or knowledge on how to effectively formulate search queries. This is particularly true for those exploring new interests or industries. The absence of a more intuitive and inclusive search mechanism hampers the ability of these users to discover relevant products or information, hindering their overall experience on the e-commerce platform.</p>
