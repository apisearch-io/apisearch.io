        {% if year == 2022 %}
            <p>During this year, growth was achieved through cold calling. Throughout 2022, two full-time employees in the company dedicated 100% of their time to product growth based on potential customer requirements and an internal roadmap. Among the features implemented are a search algorithm change, the implementation of multisite, and the definition of the rules and campaigns system.</p>
            <p>For a total of 4 months, none of the partners received any payment as investments were made to attend an ecommerce event in Barcelona (eshow), and one of the team members was on paternity leave.</p>
            <p>There is also an observed increase in infrastructure spending as Apisearch's AWS credits expired.</p>
            <p>At the end of the year, there is an intermittent increase in revenue, related to the collection of some setups.</p>

        {% elseif year == 2023 %}
            <p>This year, 2023, has been primarily dedicated to completing a product to continue growing organically. The year began with a reduction in staff to just one person, the founder and majority partner. In the middle of the year, a temporary full-time worker was added to finalize the product, focusing on integrations with payment systems and high-level automations.</p>
            <p>Towards the end of the year, an intern was added, responsible for content generation, marketing campaigns, and defining growth in terms of brand and presence on social media and search engines.</p>
            <p>During the third quarter, the company's two main objectives were the definition and implementation of a semantic and conversational search system and the initiation of organic growth for the company.</p>
