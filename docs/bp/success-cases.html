            <h4>Platanomelon</h4>
            <h5>Platanomelon made a strategic transition from a rudimentary search engine, initially tailored for Shopify, to the advanced and seamless Apisearch integrated platform. This transformative decision has significantly enhanced Platanomelon's online presence and user experience across multiple countries, including Spain and México.<br>
Prior to adopting Apisearch, Platanomelon encountered various challenges with their previous basic search engine. The issues ranged from frequent crashes (approximately 50% of the time) that hindered the overall functionality, to a subpar analysis quality and limited customization options. The search engine's unreliability and lack of advanced features prompted Platanomelon to seek a more robust solution.<br><br>
With the implementation of Apisearch, Platanomelon has witnessed remarkable successes in their online performance. Notably, both the Spanish and Mexican stores have experienced an impressive click-through rate (CTR) ranging between 75% to 80%. This significant improvement is a testament to the reliability and efficiency of Apisearch's search capabilities.<br><br>
Furthermore, Platanomelon has received positive feedback from their users, affirming the improved search experience and overall satisfaction with the platform. The collaboration with Apisearch has not only addressed the initial requirements set by Platanomelon but has also exceeded expectations, providing a comprehensive and tailored solution to their specific needs.<br><br>
In summary, Platanomelon's switch to the Apisearch integrated platform has not only resolved the challenges they faced with their previous search engine but has also elevated their online performance, user satisfaction, and overall e-commerce capabilities across international markets.</h5>

            <h4>Carethy</h4>
            <h5>Carethy, a global enterprise with nearly 120 stores operating in 12 languages worldwide, strategically transitioned from Algolia to optimize its online presence. The decision was motivated by the quest for a more cost-effective solution that could efficiently handle their substantial web traffic and cater to their diverse multilingual audience.<br><br>
The challenges faced by Carethy included the prohibitively high cost associated with Algolia, difficulties in finding a reliable service supporting multisite functionality, and the need for a customized and flexible search layer. In response to these challenges, Carethy successfully implemented a series of measures.<br><br>
On the positive side, they achieved seamless integration of their entire platform through a unified feed, providing comprehensive support. The management of all their sites was consolidated, enabling streamlined operations through a single feed, index, and admin panel. Importantly, Carethy significantly reduced service costs by adopting a predictable monthly fee structure.<br><br>
The success story continued with an impressive Click-Through Rate (CTR) of around 45%, a noteworthy achievement for a store with multiple brands and categories. Carethy's transition not only addressed their initial pain points but also positioned them for greater efficiency and success in the dynamic landscape of online retail.</h5>
